# DAEN 429 Project 
## Team Members
#### Kayla Levy, Manaswi Luitel, and Zain Bharde
## How to run code
#### All Python notebooks were created and ran in Google Colab environment. The order to run the notebooks would be from `TA_Finetuned.ipynb` to `SA_Finetuned.ipynb`. Be sure to also change folder paths as they are specific the team's Google drive. 
## Notebook/Model Overview
#### Each Python notebook entails the follwing
1. Extracting the training and test datasets via a zip file from Kaggle
2. Peforming data augmentation to the training set
3. Hyperparameter Tuning
4. Building and training the final model
5. Testing the model on the test set and visualizing model performance and prediction results
## Checkpoints
#### Best-performing model checkpoints are saved in this folder and can be accessed for evaluation or further training.
