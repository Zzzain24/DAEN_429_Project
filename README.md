## Notebook/Model Overview
#### Each Python notebook entails the follwing
1. Extracting the training and test datasets via a zip file from Kaggle
2. Peforming data augmentation to the training set
3. Hyperparameter Tuning
4. Building and training the final model
5. Testing the model on the test set and visualizing model performance and prediction results
